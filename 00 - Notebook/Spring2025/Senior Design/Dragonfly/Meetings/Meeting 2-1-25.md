# Agenda
- Future communication
	- Repeating meeting time and day of the week
- Hardware
	- Will we have access to the hardware?
	- Is the documentation or example projects built on the hardware?
	- What are the hardware specs?
	- Are we valuing realism or performance?
		- For example, realistic visibility (bad sandstorm removing visibility) and methane fluids, should they be as realistic as possible? Or more gamified that feels accurate?
			- Full fluid sims are expensive and illusion of realism would be better here.
- Design
	- Do you have any design documents?
		- Gameplay loop
	- Is movement the only gameplay?
	- Might there be sample collection or spectrometer processing minigames?
	- How does unlockable areas work?
		- Will there be an upgrade system to allow areas to be unlocked?
	- Any prototypes?
	- Are the controls on one screen and the gameplay on another? Or is it all on one screen?
	- Will the drone be able to take damage? From asteroid showers, cold weather from methane rain, or from strong winds?
		- If so what happens when the health is zero or negative?
	- "methane rain, low visibility, strong winds, and asteroid showers"
		- How might these look/act?
	- Wind and weather simulations? (Will there be extreme weather events like wind storms?)
	- How might temperature work with how cold the planet is? Will the player need to keep track how cold the drone is?
	- How might the power management system work?
		- How might the player be able to divert power?
	- Since biomes were mentioned, how might they work? Will each have their own mechanical differences?
	- Will we also model the initial landing of the drone? A "aeroshell and parachute descent"
		- https://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/News-and-Resources/docs/34_03-Lorenz.pdf
	- How might the controls look?
		- Coordinates system? Like a map?
		- Touch screen slider UI?
		- Is the landing procedure automatic?
	- Will there be a definitive win or end state?
- Assets
	- Map, do we have access to a heightmap? Topological map?
		- How large might the map be?
	- SFX
		- Are those provided?
	- Models and Textures
		- What models and textures are provided?
		- Are there variants of models and props? Such as boulders
	- Shaders
		- Are any shaders provided besides engine default ones?
		- example: atmospheric scattering/atmosphere shader to provide a realistic atmosphere, video example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxfEbulyFcY
	- VFX
		- Will you be providing VFX?
		- example: sandstorm visuals, methane rain visuals
		- If not, will particle/vfx textures be provided?
	- Animations
		- What animations are needed/are given?
		- Will assistance be provided if we need to make our own?
- What is the end goal of the project? In a science museum?
	- Is there a plan to get this project into a science museum? Or whats the current plan?
# Notes
- Player has map on screen
- Documentation is necessary
