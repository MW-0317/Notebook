# Features
*Taken from the Dragonfly Titan Pitch Presentation*
- **Realistic Physics & Atmospheric Effects**: The game will implement real-world physics based on Titan’s low gravity and dense atmosphere. Flight dynamics are affected by wind, storms, and rough terrain or proximity to hazards.
- **Topological map**: The Topological map will show each mission goals and possible landing zones. It will show the available areas to fly, the areas that can be un-lock with the progression of the game.
- **Power Management System**: The player must constantly monitor the drone’s power levels, factoring in flight time, extreme weather conditions, and environmental recharge points.
- **Dynamic Scanning & Data Collection**: Each area the player explores has scientific significance. Players will scan specific objects and environments for research points. Different biomes will have different data categories to collect, pushing the player to explore more challenging regions.
- **Landing Zones & Survival**: Finding safe and strategic landing zones is key to the game. Some areas offer abundant solar energy, while others might offer geothermal energy for a quicker recharge but are riskier to access due to rough terrain or proximity to hazards.

- **Realistic Controls**: Having controls as close as possible to the real Dragonfly Titan mission.
