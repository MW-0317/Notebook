### Hypothesis
By modifying specific parts of the genomes that make up the legs and feet it should be possible to create a rabbitfolk that is faster than most and even possible for one to cross the speed of a cheetah. Rabbitfolk are small and light creatures and it is most certainly possible to make them faster.
### Previous Research
In previous research 
### Methodology
By taking parts of the rabbitfolk genome and modifying them to enhance certain aspects of what makes a rabbit fast, namely leg muscles, leg length, reflexes, etc, we can theoretically enhance a subject's speed. This experiment will only enhance the leg muscles, making them easier to build and keep. With this experiment we will compare speed, muscle gain, and muscle strength by comparing their times in a 100m sprint, how quickly they build muscle with a few specific exercises, and how much muscle can be carried compared to body weight. All of these factors will then be compared against rabbitfolk of the same age. If we find that some or all of these factors are greater than at least one standard deviation above the mean of the other rabbitfolk tested then further experimentation can commence.
### Results
Subject P1S (Parallax Shift, first of the litter) doesn't seem to have any improvements on speed, against rabbitfolk of the same age. In most areas they falls around the average that rabbitfolk typically run at. However muscle strength and muscle gain is slightly above the mean it does not meet our standards of at least one standard deviation above the mean.
### Conclusion
Since this experiment hadn't crossed one standard deviation above the mean, they shouldn't be fit for more experimentation and testing. It should be attempted they are given to a Caring Family. It should be noted this experiment was not given proper testing as it would require years of ongoing research, however since our expectation was not met, they should be let go.
