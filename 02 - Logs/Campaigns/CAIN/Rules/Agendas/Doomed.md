**Xenoflesh**: Discard '1's rolled for gaining Sin.
**Humanity's Last Breath**: Pick a sin mark you have. Evolve that Sin mark. It no longer modifies resistance rolls.
**Quickening**: When you gain 2 or more Sin as part of an action, your action also gains +1D.
**Sympathetic Mutation**: You may take 1d3 sin to grant an ally the benefits of any sin mark ability you have for one scene. Their body is infected by a lesser version of it that dissipates when the scene is over.
**Metamorphosis**: Between missions or when resting, you can gain 1 sin to re-roll the ability of one of your sin marks. If you gain an ability you already have, choose one instead.
