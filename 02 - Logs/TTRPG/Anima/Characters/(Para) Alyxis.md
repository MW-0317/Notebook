# Early Life
Set upon the doorsteps of the \[INSERT NAME HERE\] family, a family of catfolk that live in \[AREA\] Alyxis was given a nice and loving childhood. Although she was rabbitfolk and her family were catfolk, it had not mattered, she was loved just as much as any of the \[INSERT FAMILY NAME\]'s children. All the way through middle and high school she ranked top of her class in races, beating children grades above her. Once university rolled around she was given a scholarship to \[INSERT UNIVERSITY NAME\] where she was encouraged to continue training her speed to compete against other incredible performers.
