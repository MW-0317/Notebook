# Backstory
**Who are you?**
I am Max(ine).
When I was young I was constrained to who I was, and I was happy. Parts of me I'd ignore, questions of who I could be, and whether I'm living the right path, following what I *should* be doing. 
> [!NOTE] Young M17
> I wonder if life is given a grade after we live it? What marks would I obtain?

I'd stay exactly who I'm "supposed" to be, molded by those who want me to be great in their eyes; was I even great in my own? I lived this path and yet the wonders of what I could be became to dense, I fell out of who I thought I was and "failed." I lost everything. I failed everyone. This clicked something in me: I'm not who I think I am; I'm whoever I choose to be. This simple idea, repeated many years in my childhood finally stuck. I didn't have to just be me, or who I thought I was, I could be whoever I wanted; whenever I want.
Does everyone have this ability? Is it innate to some and unobtainable for others?

*Meta note: my edit blasphemy (Mimic/Uniform) is what is being described here: the ability to be anyone Max chooses, however Max doesn't realize this is atypical. Also I really like the idea that it replicates our real human desire to be who we choose to be rather than who defines us.*
